<p>
to build resite:<br />
<ul><li>make</li></ul>
output will be in build/

if you are in windows:
c:\python3\python.exe .\src\xtp.py .\resite\resite.py
this will generate an index.html wherever you are in the filesystem, the makefile keeps things neat in build/
eventually I'll write a .bat or something
